= Profile Family

Every profile is a member of a _profile_ _family_.  A profile family
is a set of profiles that share the same base ISA but which vary in
highest-supported privilege mode.  The initial two types of family
are:

- generic unprivileged instructions (I)
- application processors running rich operating systems (A)

NOTE: More profile families may be added over time.

A profile family may be updated no more than annually, and the release
calendar year is treated as part of the profile family name.

Each profile family is described in more detail below.
