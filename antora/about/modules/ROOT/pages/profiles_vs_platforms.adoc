= Profiles versus Platforms

Profiles only describe ISA features, not a complete execution
environment.

A _software_ _platform_ is a specification for an execution
environment, in which software targeted for that software platform can
run.

A _hardware_ _platform_ is a specification for a hardware system
(which can be viewed as a physical realization of an execution
environment).

Both software and hardware platforms include specifications for many
features beyond details of the ISA used by RISC-V harts in the
platform (e.g., boot process, calling convention, behavior of
environment calls, discovery mechanism, presence of certain
memory-mapped hardware devices, etc.).  Architecture profiles factor
out ISA-specific definitions from platform definitions to allow ISA
profiles to be reused across different platforms, and to be used by
tools (e.g., compilers) that are common across many different
platforms.

A platform can add additional constraints on top of those in a
profile.  For example, mandating an extension that is a standard
option in the underlying profile, or constraining some
implementation-specific parameter in the profile to lie within a
certain range.

A platform cannot remove mandates or reduce other requirements in a
profile.

NOTE: A new profile should be proposed if existing profiles do not
match the needs of a new platform.
